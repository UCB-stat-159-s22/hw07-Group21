# College Majors Analysis

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/UCB-stat-159-s22/hw07-Group21/main?labpath=main.ipynb)

This repository presents several analyses of college outcomes by major. The original data that inspired the project comes from a [FiveThirtyEight article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/) and the associated [Github repo](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors). 


The processed data used for this analysis can be found in `data/pums/processed/` and the majors list is in `data/fivethirtyeight/majors-list.csv`. The narrative analysis of this data is in `main.ipynb`. 


## Data Reporducibility

To redownload and process the original PUMS data for 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018: 
```
make env  # sets up environment
make raw_pums_data
make all_grad_data
```
Once this data has been saved, to run the python scripts that extract gender, grad degree, and income data use the make targets
```
make major_stats # computes wage and gender stats for recent grads by major
make grad_stats # computes wage and gender stats split by graduate degree or not 
=======
To download and process origina PUMS data for 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018: 
```
```

This process will save a csv per year of the form `20XX_recent_grad_stats_by_major.csv` to `data/pums/processed` with summary statistics for each year grouped by major. 

To access the intermediate raw data for each year (only a subset of features collected) you can load the file `XX_edu_wage_data.csv` from `data/pums/processed` where `XX` corrsponds to the last two digits of the year. 



## Troubleshooting

For environment set up and data:

1. If you encounter `ModuleNotFoundError`, try to run `conda activate hw7env`
2. If you encounter `CommandNotFoundError: Your shell has not been properly configured to use 'conda activate'.`, try to run `conda init --all`. Then close your terminal without shutting it down. Reopen it, and run the make command again.
